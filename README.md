# Welcome to my repository
I'll showcase a collection of projects developed during my academic journey, personal endeavors, and collaborations with talented individuals. These projects represent my experience in software engineering (full stack), and machine learning, as well as my ability to work effectively within teams on collaborative projects.

This repository includes both individual projects I have worked on and collaborative projects with my peers, where we applied diverse skills to solve real-world challenges. Below, you will find detailed descriptions of each project, along with the technologies used, goals, and key outcomes.

## Collaborative Projects
Collaboration has been a cornerstone of my experience, and I have had the privilege of working with talented individuals from diverse backgrounds. Below are some of the projects where I collaborated with other students, professionals, or teams to create solutions that required a blend of expertise.

### Hotel Managment System
Description: I collaborated with 5 teammates to implement a hotel management system in C++. The Project HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is an application that allows the hotel manager to handle all hotel activities online. Interactive GUI and the ability to manage various hotel bookings and rooms make this system very flexible and convenient. Hotel Management project provides room booking, staff management and other necessary hotel management features. The system allows the manager to post available rooms in the system.

My Role: As the coordinator of the group, I managed to divide tasks and keep track of the work while also helping and fixing any errors, and contributed to user interface design.

Technologies Used: C++
Outcome: We managed to score the highest grade in the project.
